* kmartino-emacs-config

This is a very simple emacs conifguration that uses (not is based upon
and modified) the Emacs Starter Kit, found here:

https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit

* Additions to the default emacs-starter-kit

The init.el is written to download a small set of packages I prefer to run
with and includes a few modifications to make it easy to get started
with:

1. Diagramming with graphviz and platinum-uml in org-mode
2. Using an installed instance of mit-scheme
3. Setting up the path Emacs uses to find external executables on your
   system.
