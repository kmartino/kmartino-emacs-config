* kmartino-emacs-config
This is a very simple emacs conifguration that uses (not is based upon
and modified) the Emacs Starter Kit, found here:

https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit

I DO NOT RECOMMEND you use this custom configuration.  If you are
creating a new emacs configuration, I recommend creating a fresh
.emacs.d directory and init.el file and following the instructions
provided by emacs-starter-kit.  Feel free to look at my configuration
here as a guide, but it is not intended for general use.

* Additions to the default emacs-starter-kit
The init.el is written to download a small set of packages I prefer to
run and includes a few modifications to make it easy to get started
with:

1. Diagramming with Graphviz and PlatUML in org-mode
2. Using an installed instance of mit-scheme
3. Setting up the path Emacs uses to find external executables on your
   system.
4. Providing an INFO version of SICP to read and follow along with.

* Instructions
In order to use this configuration you will need the following
installed on your system:

1. Graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/
2. PlantUML: http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/
3. MIT Scheme: https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/

You will need to modify init.el and set MIT_SCHEME_INSTALL to the
location of your MIT Scheme binary.

* TODOs
1. Modify PATH discovery so that it works on Windows (in progress)
2. Enable the configuration to auto-detect dependencies and report if
   they are missing.
* A Million Thanks
